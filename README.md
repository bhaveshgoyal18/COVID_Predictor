# COVID_Predictor
With this you can easily check the chances of getting affected by the COVID-19.
You have to only tell the answers of the asked questions.
Basically i got an idea to make this on the "JANTA CURFEW' since I was getting bored so decided to tympass with this.

#This is the simplest python code for COVID_prediction.
